title: Crimson Chaos

The Crimson Chaos might sound like a hellish nightmare plane where nothing makes sense and you grow slowly madder and madder until you eventually snap. And that's because it is -- Welcome to Earth!

Crimson Chaos is the first campaign setting I've run multiple sessions in, for my "Campaign 1" -- "Kirampaign". It's played with my first party, the "Kirampaigns in my ass".

_I will eventually be updating this page with more information I see as suitable for sharing, and relevant to my players._
