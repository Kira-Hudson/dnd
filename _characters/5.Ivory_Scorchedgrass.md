Ivory Scorchedgrass was born unto Lori Scorchedgrass, a fairy warrior who fell in love with a succubus.

Ivory is now part of a crew on a ship transporting spices, working for an organisation of assassins run by her adoptive father, and possessed by a strange entity in the form of many tattoos covering her body. Fun times :3
