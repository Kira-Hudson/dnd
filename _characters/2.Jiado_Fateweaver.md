Jiado Fateweaver is a fighter. Thatâ€™s all you need to know about her. She fights for what she believes is right. She fights for her friends. But most importantly, and perhaps even unbeknownst to her, she fights for herself.

Jiado is a 5'11, 23-year-old vulpine woman who thought she was vocal about her opinions until she met her friends. It's not an uncommon occurrence when someone who isn't one grows up around exclusively elves. By day, Jiado is an adventurer with her friends, but at night she hunts for bounties to make ends meat. Well, she doesn't need to make that anymore. Old habits die hard, I guess.

Since soon after meeting her friends, especially noting one particular warlock, Jiado has been having infrequent and irregular visions from the goddess of fate, Vilfar, who Jiado's party helped to restore by aiding Vilfar's lover, Fel'Dathar, god of conquest, to destroy her brother, Wiles, god of death. This was only a month or two after they had to "defeat" their own friend, Tsukasa Bridge, after he went crazy and tried to destroy the universe (I'm paraphrasing).

Everyone in the criminal underground has heard of the Beesting, and they'd rather not experience it for themselves. In this universe, Jiado grew up fighting all sorts of people in an underground "fight club" (it wasn't exactly optional). She made a name for herself and fought to the top of the ranks (of captive fighters).

*She may be rescued by this world's misfits at some point when they go on their slave trade-busting quest.*

### Champion Fateweaver

> **Class** _[Buffed]({{ site.baseurl }}/homebrew/source.buff_zone.html) Fighter 10 (Champion)_

In a world where fighter was actually good, and I didn't need to multiclass Jiado out of it to have fun in combat (I guess I could've roleplayed a little more, but that's not the point! ðŸ˜¡)
