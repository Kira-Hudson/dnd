- name: Bite
  desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the ammit can't bite another target or use Absorb Souls."

- name: Tail
  desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage."
- name: Swallow
  desc: The ammit makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ammit, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the ammit's turns. If the ammit takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the ammit must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the ammit. If the ammit dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
- name: Absorb Souls (Recharge 5-6)
  desc: The ammit inhales life force in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it is swallowed by the ammit (see Swallow above).

An ammit is made up of a hippo, lion and crocodile, the three biggest 'man-eaters' of Egypt. It is a servant of Anubis and devours the souls of the wicked, impure and unworthy.
