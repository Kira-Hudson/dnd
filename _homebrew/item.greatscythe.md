This weapon is inspired by the common farming implement used to cut swaths of grown hay, but despite its humble origins, the scythe is recognized as a symbol of death in many cultures because of its use in reaping. The weapons themselves are usually plain, sleek black well-balanced staffs with their blades arching away from the ends of the left side. These greater heavier versions of scythes generally stand about 6 to 8 feet tall and instils fear in opponents as if a strange survival instinct is at work.
