A red and black great scythe wielded by a mighty warrior to conquer darkness. This great scythe can be converted into a much shorter size for transport purposes. This scythe has 6\* charges. As an action, you may spend a charge\* to shoot out a wave of energy from the scythe. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Vorpal. When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

The scythe regains 1d6\* expended charges at dawn.

\* changed 12 charges with 2 used every time to 6 charges with 1 used, and removed +2 bonus to regained charges at dawn.
